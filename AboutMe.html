                Welcome! My name is Ethan and I am a senior Computer Science and Cybersecurity major at George Fox University, and I am pleased to introduce myself. 
                <br><br>
                A little bit about me:
                I love trying out new hobbies and learning new skills.
                As a student and a part-time barista at <a href="http://www.chaptersbooksandcoffee.com/" target="_blank">Chapters</a> in Newberg, Oregon, I am an avid coffee enthusiast and I enjoy making espresso-based drinks for myself and friends; finding a good coffeeshop is the first thing I do when I'm in a new place! I also love baking breads and pastries of all sorts. I've played the cello since 5th grade and have played for my highschool, university, the Tacoma Youth Symphony, and my church's worship team.
                <br><br>
                As a resident of the Pacific Northwest, I enjoy being active and getting outdoors. I can often be found at my school's rock climbing wall and have been able to do some outdoor climbing at Smith Rock along with plenty of hiking and several backpacking trips.
                <br><br>
                During my time in the Computer Science and Cybersecurity program at George Fox, I have gained a breadth of technical skills and comprehension.
                I've coded in several high-level Object-Oriented Programming languages and I've used shell and python scripting for a variety of applications. In my cybersecurity courses I've studied security best practices, the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank">OWASP Top Ten</a> and penetration testing against a variety of systems. I've participated with my peers in the <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/" target="_blank">National Cyber League</a> competition and will participate again in this next year's Fall and Spring sessions.
